# photos.py

`photos.py` is a Python script designed to help you organize and manage your photo collection. It allows you to easily manipulate images, rename files, organize them into directories based on metadata (such as date and location), and much more.

## Features
- **Organize photos**: Automatically sort photos into folders based on metadata like date or location.
- **Batch rename**: Rename multiple photos in bulk with customizable naming schemes.
- **Metadata extraction**: Extract EXIF metadata from images to sort or rename photos.
- **Flexible and extensible**: Easily extend or modify the script to suit your needs.

## Requirements
Before running `photos.py`, make sure you have Python 3.6+ and the following Python packages installed:
- `pillow` (for image manipulation)
- `exifread` (for reading EXIF metadata)

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danieladmon/photos.py.git
cd photos.py
```
Install the required Python libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you have the script and dependencies set up, you can run the script with the following command:
```bash
python photos.py
```

**Configuration**
You can configure the script by editing the settings at the top of the photos.py file. Here, you can define your preferred directory structure, file naming schemes, and metadata preferences.
This is now correctly formatted to be part of your GitHub `README.md`. You can copy this directly to ensure it fits the rest of the file structure smoothly. Let me know if this works for you!
