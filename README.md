photos.py by Daniel Admon

This script is made to make my life easier.
I'm a photographer that shoot in RAW and JPEG.
why JPEG and RAW ? because RAW is a large file and its slower then JPEG
so its faster to view and organize photos with JPEG,
and when i'm editing the photos i'm using the RAW files.

The script check if there are RAW file without the JPG file and delete the RAW file.
